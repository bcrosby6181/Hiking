CoNerd Web Page

Create a web page based on something "nerdy" you like.  This can be video games, a hoppy, a job, anything you like!

This web page should be done in HTML and CSS only.  Do not use a HTML editor -- Code only in notepad.

Main page should be named: index.html and the other can be named anything.

You will include: (these requirements do not have to be on both pages-
put a mixture of the required topics on either of the two pages.)

- Body color
- Set a page margin
- CSS inline
- Clear navigation
- Heading tags
- Font style, color and sizes ** Do not use more than 3 different font faces **
- Paragraph tags (@ least 1 division tag)
- Specific CSS class
- Use a border around a paragraph or div tags
- Span tag
- Line breaks when appropriate
- Comment code accordingly

Be creative and show me what you are capable of, but please remember your time frame!

Your page will be G or PG rated - no exceptions!
